To mimic your style, a few million words might do. To mirror your mind, we need not only your words but your reasoning structure, your habits of contrast, humor, pattern-recognition, and moral weighting — and that requires variety and context, not just volume.\n\nHere’s the short version:\n\nSmall fine-tunes (LoRA/SFT style):\nIf you start with a strong base model like Llama-3-8B or Qwen-2.5-7B, around 50k–100k tokens (≈ 25k–50k words) of high-signal data — dialogues, essays, commentaries, project notes, story drafts, annotated decisions — can already shift tone and priorities recognizably. That’s a “personality seasoning.”\n\nMedium (persona-level mirroring):\nFor a clear, reproducible “Toddness,” you’d want 500k–1M tokens (≈ 250k–500k words). That’s roughly the equivalent of several novels plus your commentary and email/chat samples. At that size, a fine-tuned model starts anticipating your rhetorical choices — the way you question assumptions or use analogy as a probe.\n\nDeep mirroring (cognitive-style reproduction):\nTo capture your reasoning and judgment patterns, you need 2–5 M tokens — around 1–2 GB of cleaned text. But it must include diverse contexts: creative writing, technical explanation, academic argument, off-the-cuff chat, humor, and moral reasoning. The richness of context matters more than raw length.\n\nIn effect, we’re not trying to clone memory; we’re modeling meta-cognition — how you move between topics, how you test a claim, when you choose irony over precision.\n\nA neat trick: parallel data. Give the model your text plus short “why I wrote it this way” notes. That helps it learn not just what you say but how you decide what to say.\n\nIf you’re building toward a Toddric-scale reflection, you already have a goldmine: years of chats, book drafts, design notes, and code commentary.

The letter 'Y' glistened at the top and seemed to be turning itself into some stylized butterfly -- bio or software? Cin wondered, her lips twitching briefly on one side as she walked through them.\\nShe craned her neck back over her shoulder for a moment as she confirmed that -- once again -- the letters had completely rearranged themselves to say:\\nYou are entering Eden.\\nAs she turned back and continued her exit, another set of floating letters asked: Entering cross-contact area.  Clothing required.\\nShe moved out of the walkway and into the alcove that was the changing area.  She went to the dorm's locker and pulled out her shipsuit through the simple expedient of reaching in and pulling out the first thing she felt.\\nValrise knew her: she would never get the wrong clothes.  She could have reached her hand into another locker and she would still have got the right clothes -- and a polite admonition as well as an unvocalized bio-check to be certain that she wasn't suffering from some mentally debilitating malady.\\nValrise was an old ship; she had developed some quirks that newer ships might not value but... Valrise was an old ship. 'An old ship is one that works' as they said.\\nCin was surprised to feel a bulkier sweater among her things.  She was going somewhere cold, she surmised, shrugging on the sweater after pulling her on her single-piece shipsuit. The sweater smelled new -- clearly something Valrise had cooked up for the occasion and had Cin's name stencilled over the left breast.\\n\\\"And some makeup,\\\" Valrise said.  \\\"There are Contacts in the ice rink.\\\"\\nCin raised an eyebrow in question.\\n\\\"They aren't used to shaved eyebrows,\\\" Valrise explained.\\n\\\"Makeup?\\\"\\n\\\"Use the dark pencil to mark your eyebrows and the synthetics will do the rest.\\\"\\nCin felt inside her locker, pulled out a slim case.  There was a mirror in it and a thin stick with dark substance on it.  Cin had used makeup before -- a couple of years back -- so she wasn't totally unfamiliar with the notion.\\n\\\"Lip color?\\\"\\n\\\"Natural will do.\\\"\\n\\\"Anything else?\\\" Cin asked after using the liner.\\n\\\"Hair,\\\" Valrise said.  Cin grinned as she looked the mirror once more and saw that hair had sprouted on the ridge of her eyebrows.  \\\"Pull the hood of the sweater up over your head.\\\"\\nCin complied.\\n\\\"The young ones are competing,\\\" Valrise told her.  \\\"The Contacts are quite amazed at our gravity control.\\\"\\n\\\"How far back are they?\\\"\\n\\\"A good 100, 150 years,\\\" the ship told her.\\n\\\"Poor, proud, and paranoid?\\\" Cin asked, repeating the mantra that the crew used when referring to earthers.\\n\\\"Exactly,\\\" the ship replied.  \\\"Now, go!\\\"\\n#\\n\\tCin was glad of the sweater when she entered the much cooler confines of the ice rink.  She paused as one of the contestants took to the ice, gained speed, and darted toward the low mound in the center.  Cin's newly applied eyebrows descended thoughtfully as she judged the positioning of the skater: she was deliberately off the central axis.\\nCin's observations were confirmed when the skater shot up the mound, entered a skew loop and neatly landed upside down on the inverted rink, and continued in a curved loop \\\"down\\\" the mound and onto the flat ice on the \\\"ceiling\\\" of the rink.  Those of the crew watching applauded mildly while the more obvious Contacts looked on in slack-jawed wonder -- anti-gravity was always one of the first technologies to be lost when colonizing new worlds.\\nValrise and the other trader ships spent some of their time re-establishing contact -- and trade -- with lost colonies.  It was short-term not as profitable as hauling goods between advanced worlds -- the advantage was in establishing long-term trade.  Valrise, in her hundred years of existence, had built up quite an extensive trading circuit. There was always danger in establishing new trading partners; care was required and friction inevitable as hopelessly out-dated planets met up with the latest techology... and culture.\\nHence the \\\"dog and pony show\\\" -- as Valrise called it.  Cin had been so intrigued by the phrase that she'd looked it up: she couldn't understand why a sentient starship would communicate with references to various four-legged mammals but she'd long ago come to recognize that the ship had a quirky sense of humor. \\nA second skater started on the downside rink and made the leap to the upside rink and then the two of them entered into a very precise -- and risky\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"meta\": {\r\n    \"path\": \"/mnt/nasa/Drive/Todd McCaffrey/At the bottom of the White (1).docx\",\r\n    \"rel_path\": \"At the bottom of the White (1).docx\",\r\n    \"ext\": \".docx\",\r\n    \"kind\": \"prose\",\r\n    \"source_sha256\": \"7860d8e94153d3dfc1bcfc396c70e7764ac366d28470dd6fd43bfe8d217e1409\",\r\n    \"approx_src_tokens\": 13697,\r\n    \"chunk_index\": 0,\r\n    \"chunk_total\": 16,\r\n    \"approx_tokens\": 1000\r\n  }\r\n}", "emotion": "disgust", "rewritten": "Ugh, I'm looking at this JSON file and it's just disgusting.
