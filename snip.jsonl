{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What have we got in the realm of build your own laptops"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Love this question! “Build your own” laptops have come a LONG way, especially for power users who want to control specs, repair, and upgrades. While it’s not as open as desktop PC building, there are now some seriously good options—especially if you want lots of RAM, big SSDs, and even choose your own keyboard/screen/GPU.\n\n---\n\n## **Top “Build Your Own” Laptop Platforms (2025)**\n\n### 1. **Framework Laptop (13, 16, and 16 Pro)**\n- **Modular, repairable, and upgradable**—the gold standard for DIY right now.\n- **Choose screen, RAM (up to 96 GB DDR5), SSD, keyboard, ports, and GPU (16/16 Pro only).**\n- **Excellent Linux compatibility** (but runs Windows beautifully).\n- **16\" and 16 Pro** support discrete GPUs, gorgeous 2.5K 165Hz screens, up to 64 or 96GB RAM.\n- **Parts easily replaceable/upgradeable**: screen, battery, mainboard (CPU!), RAM, SSD, ports, keyboard, fans.\n- **Open ecosystem:** 3rd party modules (even from CoolerMaster, etc.).\n- **Downsides:**  \n    - OLED option *just* started rolling out (check current configs!).\n    - No touch on most screens (yet), but strong rumors for late 2025.\n    - Pro/16: slightly heavier than “ultrabooks”.\n\n[See: https://frame.work/](https://frame.work/)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Clevo-based Laptops (via System Integrators)**\n- **White-label “barebones” chassis**—sold under brands like Sager, XMG, Schenker, Eluktronics, Eurocom, Tuxedo, and others.\n- **Custom-build at order**:  \n    - Choose CPU (Intel/AMD), GPU, RAM (up to 128GB on some models), SSD, screen (often up to 4K or QHD 240Hz, some OLED options appearing in 2025).\n    - Some offer touch screens (rarer, but possible—ask each vendor).\n- **Easy to open and upgrade:** RAM, SSD, WiFi, sometimes keyboard and battery.\n- **Linux/Windows compatible**—great for dual boot.\n- **Downsides:**  \n    - Not as thin/sexy as MacBook/XPS.\n    - Battery life can be average.\n    - Build quality can vary (Schenker/XMG and Eurocom are “pro” grade, some others feel plasticky).\n\n[Examples: XMG (Europe): https://bestware.com/en/xmg-laptops.html ](https://bestware.com/en/xmg-laptops.html)  \n[Eurocom: https://eurocom.com/ ](https://eurocom.com/)  \n[Sager (US): https://www.sagernotebook.com/ ](https://www.sagernotebook.com/)  \n[Tuxedo (Linux focus): https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/ ](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/)\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Other Upgradable/Modular Laptops**\n- **Dell Precision and HP ZBook** (workstation lines): Some models let you swap RAM, SSD, WiFi, and even GPU in the high-end ones, but less modular than Framework or Clevo.\n- **ASUS ProArt and ROG “DIY” kits:**  \n    - In Asia/EU, sometimes you can buy “barebones” ROG/ProArt and add your own RAM/SSD, but CPU/GPU is usually fixed.\n\n---\n\n## **Current Limitations**\n- **Touchscreen OLED + Full DIY:** Framework will likely get there soon, but most Clevo systems still focus on IPS, with OLED slowly appearing (ask vendors for latest panels).\n- **CPU and GPU:**  \n    - Framework: CPU upgrades = new mainboard swap (but that’s designed to be easy!).\n    - Clevo: CPU (Intel 14th gen, usually not upgradable post-purchase), GPU sometimes MXM or proprietary, RAM/SSD are always upgradable.\n\n---\n\n## **DIY “Builder” Experience**\n- With Framework, you order “DIY Edition” and literally assemble: screen, RAM, SSD, WiFi, keyboard, expansion cards.\n- With Clevo/Sager/XMG, you configure your build online (RAM, SSD, GPU, screen), and can upgrade/repair everything later, but less LEGO-like than Framework.\n\n---\n\n## **Who Should Go Modular?**\n- **You want to keep your laptop for 5–7+ years** and upgrade/repair as tech improves.\n- **You want Linux compatibility, less e-waste, and more control.**\n- **You’re okay with “business/pro” looks over “ultra-slim” style.**\n\n---\n\n### **Would you like:**\n- A custom Framework 16 Pro “shopping list” with max specs?\n- Or links to Eurocom/XMG models with 64GB/2TB/touch OLED options?\n- Advice on which DIY route is best for you?\n\nLet me know your OS/workflow priorities and if you want latest OLED/touch updates for Framework or Clevo—happy to get granular!"}], "meta": {"source": "chatgpt_export", "conversation_title": "Laptop for NAS Photoshop", "id": "68613958-a3d8-800e-a0ea-53de09d888ff", "time_iso": "2025-06-29T13:02:16.942787Z"}, "uid": "669496c37b46fa48", "tags": ["aug", "merged"]}
